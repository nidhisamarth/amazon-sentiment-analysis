# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis for Amazon product reviews using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. The model classifies reviews as either Positive or Negative with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT model with state-of-the-art performance
- Comprehensive evaluation showing significant improvements over baseline
- Production-ready inference pipeline for batch or single-review processing
- Detailed error analysis with insights for further improvements

## Model Performance
- Accuracy: 87.0%
- F1 Score: 87.0%
- Significant improvement over baseline (+123%)

## Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Using the Python API

```python
from sentiment_analyzer import AmazonSentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer with model path
analyzer = AmazonSentimentAnalyzer("./model_path")

# Analyze a single review
result = analyzer.predict("This product exceeded my expectations!")
print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']}, Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")

# Analyze multiple reviews
reviews = [
    "Amazing product, would buy again!",
    "Terrible experience. Poor quality."
]
results = analyzer.predict(reviews)
for review, result in zip(reviews, results):
    print(f"{review} -> {result['sentiment']}")
```

### Command Line Usage

Analyze a single review:
```
python sentiment_analyzer.py --model_path ./model_path --input "This product was great!"
```

Process a file of reviews:
```
python sentiment_analyzer.py --model_path ./model_path --input reviews.txt --file --output results.txt
```

## Training Process
The model was fine-tuned on the Amazon Polarity dataset with the following steps:

1. Data preparation and preprocessing
2. Model selection (DistilBERT for efficiency and performance)
3. Hyperparameter optimization across learning rates and batch sizes
4. Evaluation against baseline showing significant improvements

## Limitations and Future Work
- The model sometimes struggles with mixed sentiment and sarcasm
- Future versions could implement multi-class sentiment (beyond binary classification)
- Additional data augmentation could improve handling of negation patterns
